network_edge-count-based_layout_xx.pdf: the cluster-to-cluster communication network in which the edge weight is edge-count.
network_total-expression-based_layout_xx.pdf: the cluster-to-cluster communication network in which the edge weight is total-expression.
network_total-specificity-based_layout_xx.pdf: the cluster-to-cluster communication network in which the edge weight is total-specificity.
Edges.csv: all filtered edges.
Mtx.xlsx: three adjacency matrices of the networks.
network_edges.csv: five weights of each cluster-to-cluster edge in the network.
