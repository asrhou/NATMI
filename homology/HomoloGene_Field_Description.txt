HomoloGeneEntrySet
------------------
Set of HomoloGeneEntry (analogous to Bioseq-set)


HomoloGeneEntry
---------------
Entry for each HomoloGene group (corresponds to each entry on
the webpage).  Contains the following:
- HomoloGeneEntry_hg-id: unique integer identifier for the group
- HomoloGeneEntry_version: version of the group (group version
  changes when elements from the group changes (e.g. new genes added)
  but the majority of the members in the group stay the same
- HomoloGeneEntry_caption: string describing highest taxonomic level
  of conservation for the group
- HomoloGeneEntry_taxid: taxonomic id for the highest taxonomic level
  of conservation for the group
- HomoloGeneEntry_genes: set of Gene objects
- HomoloGeneEntry_cr-date: creation date for HomoloGene group
- HomoloGeneEntry_up-date: last update date for HomoloGene group
- HomoloGeneEntry_distances: set of Stats objects
- HomoloGeneEntry_commentaries: set of CommentarySet objects


Gene
----
Contains information about each gene in a HomoloGene group.  Contains
the following:
- Gene_geneid: GeneID (from EntrezGene) identifier
- Gene_symbol: "best" symbol for gene (official if available)
- Gene_title: name of the gene
- Gene_taxid: taxonomic id for the gene
- Gene_prot-gi: gi of protein used for calculations
- Gene_prot-acc: accession of protein used for calculations
- Gene_prot-len: length of protein used for calculations
- Gene_nuc-gi: gi of corresponding mRNA to protein used in
  calculations (if available)
- Gene_nuc-acc: accession of corresponding mRNA to proteinused in
  calculations (if available)
- Gene_domains: set of Domain objects


Domain
------
Contains information of domains for each protein in a HomoloGene
group.  Contains the following:
- Domain_begin: beginning position of the domain
- Domain_end: end position of the domain
- Domain_pssm-id: PSSM id of the domain
- Domain_cdd-id: CDD id of the domain
- Domain_cdd-name: common name of the domain


Stats
-----
Contains different pairwise statistics between the proteins in a
HomoloGene group.  Contains the following:
- Stats_gi1: gi of the first protein in the pair
- Stats_gi2: gi of the second protein in the pair
- Stats_nuc-change: ratio of nucleotide differences between the pair
- Stats_nuc-change-jc: ratio of nucleotide differences between the
  pair (corrected for back substitions through Jukes and Cantor
  formula)
- Stats_prot-change: ratio of amino acid differences between the pair
- Stats_ka: Ka for the pair (ratio of non-synonymous differences per
  non-synonymous site)
- Stats_ks: Ks for the pair (ratio of synonymous differences per
  synonymous site)
- Stats_knr: Knr for the pair (ratio of radical non-synonymous
  differences per radical non-synonymous site)
- Stats_knc: Knc for the pair (ratio of conservative non-synonymous
  differences per conservative non-synonymous site)
- Stats_recip-best: is this pair reciprocal best using bitscore as
  the measurement


CommentarySet
-------------
Set of Commentary objects.  Contains the following:
- CommentarySet_title: string describing what type of commentaries this
  set contains
- CommentarySet_commentaries: set of Commentary objects


Commentary
----------
Provides information and links to other information pertaining to
members of a HomoloGene group.  Contains the following:
- Commentary_link: link to source of other information.
  Contains the following:
  - Link_hypertext: simple description of the content of the link
  - Link_url: URL of the link
- Commentary_description: description of contents of the data
- Commentary_provider: name of the source of the data
